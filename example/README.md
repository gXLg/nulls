This app creates a website `Null Chat` with two users:

| Username    | Password    |
|-------------|-------------|
| gXLg        | password123 |
| MrAnonymous | qwertzuiop  |

Contains placeholder values for global and private chat.
It includes basic authentification logic, but has
almost no validation, so a not logged in user could
potentially read messages if he abuses the API.

The website is pretty much static,
and nothing can be changed on it.
